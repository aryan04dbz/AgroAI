# AgroAI -Crop Prediction Using AI

## 🚀 Project Overview
This repository contains the project *Crop Prediction Using AI*, developed for **JIS IDEAJAM** by **Asansol Engineering College**. The project leverages AI and machine learning to help farmers predict crop yields and choose the best crops based on soil and weather conditions.

## 💡 Problem Statement
**Global Issues:**
- Food insecurity due to unpredictable crop yields.
- Economic disparities affecting small-scale farmers.

**Challenges Faced:**
- Unpredictable crop yields due to climate change.
- Impact of pests, soil degradation, and sudden weather changes.
- Financial losses and increased debt for farmers.

## 💡 Proposed Solution
The AI-driven platform offers:
- **Crop Suggestions:** Top 3 best crops based on soil reports and external conditions.
- **Data Forecasting:** Accurate predictions using machine learning models.
- **Chatbot Support:** Seamless interaction with a user-friendly chatbot.
- **Multi-language Support:** Options for farmers to choose their preferred language.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
### Frontend:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js (Responsive UI)
### Backend:
- Node.js, Express.js (API handling)
### Machine Learning:
- Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn)
### Database:
- MongoDB (Scalable data storage)

## 📊 Data Pipeline Workflow
1. **Farmer Input:** Location, crop type, land area, fertilizers, pesticides, and soil report.
2. **Data Fetching:** Real-time weather and temperature data via APIs.
3. **Yield Prediction:** ML models (Random Forest Regression & Classifier, 97.8% accuracy).
4. **Dashboard Insights:** Interactive results and recommendations.

## 🌟 Key Benefits
- **Social:** Enhances food security and educates farmers.
- **Economic:** Boosts agricultural output and attracts investments.
- **Farmer-Centric:** Reduces losses and improves resource management.
- **Environmental:** Promotes sustainable farming and climate resilience.

## 💰 Financial Feasibility
- **Revenue Model:** Free basic features with premium AI-driven insights.
- **Scalability:** Region-specific AI models for wider market expansion.
- **Cost-Efficient:** Uses scalable cloud solutions to minimize expenses.

## 🧩 Challenges Faced
- Data collection and preprocessing issues.
- Balancing model accuracy and computational efficiency.
- Promoting farmer awareness and trust in AI-based solutions.
